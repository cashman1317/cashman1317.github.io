         <p>
            I am a senior in highschool and I am looking at collages right now. One of the things that I did not know befor this year is how many college applications I have to do it get into college.
            
            I have also taken engineering for three years because I think it is one of the best classes in the school. I love it because it allows me to always be creative and come up with fun ways to problem solve.
